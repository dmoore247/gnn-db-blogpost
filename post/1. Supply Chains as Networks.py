# MAGIC ## 1. Supply Chains as Networks
# MAGIC We live in an ever interconnected world. Nowhere is this more evident than our global supply chains. Modern supply chains have become intricately linked and weaved together due to the global macroeconomic environment and globalisation. In modern supply chains, companies rely on one another to keep their production lines flowing and to act in an ethical manner by ensuring they source from ethical suppliers. The relationships between firms in this global network of companies buying and selling from another form a dynamic complex network.  
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Most companies typically consider only a single set of connections from this complex network, or their tier 1 suppliers. This exposes firms to significant amounts of risk due to a lack of transparency. This post focuses on building resilient supply chains using the power of data and machine learning by showing how companies can have a real-time view of their supply chain after having collected some representative data. We will develop a dashboard that executives or supply chain analysts can use to monitor their supply chain. We will assume for this post that a company has developed a way to gather this dataset either by using commercial databases or published web information ([see here for automated method using natural language processing and deep learning using web data](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339103487_Extracting_supply_chain_maps_from_news_articles_using_deep_neural_networks)). 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Since the supply chain network is inevitably going to be incomplete and change over time, we will also demonstrate training and productionising Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to continuously monitor and refine the collected supply chain network data. The GNN will learn from connectivity patterns that have been gathered to find missing information in the form of links. Formally, in the graph representation learning literature, this prediction task is described as link prediction.

# MAGIC ## 2. Building Resilient Supply Chains
# MAGIC The first step to building resilient supply chains is to have visibility over the supply chain itself. There have been multiple instances where companies have fallen victim to a lack of visibility in their supply chains. Examples include suppliers of suppliers that do not comply with the Modern Slavery Act or are involved in known nefarious activities. Furthermore, there could be production risk associated with suppliers of suppliers from untrustworthy business practices or even hidden geographic risk exposure. These shocks have led to both financial and reputational implications for firms that have fallen victim to this lack of transparency. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For this post, we're going to assume that a company has set up the pre-requisite architecture to obtain potential buying and selling relationships between firms with some probability score. This data will be streamed to cloud storage and will be incrementally ingested ([```autoloader```](https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/structured-streaming/auto-loader.html)). We then also incorporate static data from our supply and finance teams that have structured information about country risk profiles as well as company risk scores to feed our executive level dashboard.
